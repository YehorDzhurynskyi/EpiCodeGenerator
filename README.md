# CODE GENERATION TOOL

Used for [EpiLib](https://github.com/YehorDzhurynskyi/EpiLib)

## Brief:
    This tool parses IDL (stands for Interface Declaration Language) files
    and produces C++ valid code to reduce boilerplate code to highlight
    processes that do things.

    A significant part of the generated code located in the build directory of
    the project which helps to reduce code submitted on the remote repository.

    Also, code generation helps mitigate errors in boilerplate
    code left by the developer's inattentiveness.
